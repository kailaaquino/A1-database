# Proposal: 
We are creating a database for a video game. Each player will be asked for their name at the end of the game and they will be assigned a unique ID. We will store their name, score, and date to post to a leaderboard which will be sorted by score. Scores can be filtered by the current date, current week, or all time. Players will be able to unlock achievements which will be stored with their ID. The persistence layer will store all the information in a table with the columns as user, score, and achievements.
